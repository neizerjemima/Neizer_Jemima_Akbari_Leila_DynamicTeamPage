        profile:"Hello! I'm Jemima. A multidisciplinary designer and developer, I offered both design and development in the creation of this website. I've always been drawn to both the creative and analytical side of development, so I'm so thankful to be able to do both with my current program. In my free time, I enjoy pursuing a variety of hobbies and activities. One of my favorite things to do is read. I love getting lost in a good book and exploring new worlds and ideas. I also enjoy obsessing over unquie design created by other designer and developer to fueling my mind ",
