# Team Page Project

TODO: In this project, we created a page for team members, and with the help of HTML, we add pictures and names of team members, a paragraph about each of them, and a list of their education. We had already designed the page by Adobe XD and based on that, we designed the elements of the page with the help of CSS and placed them in the desired place. Because of the CSS if you hover your mouse on any image of the team members, it will show a border around them, which gives the impression of being clickable. Then we wrote JS code for them, and with the help of JS code, if you click on the photo of each team member, their information will appear in the white box under the photos.
